# Inverse Colors

Inverse Colors is an interactive web application built with React and TypeScript. It's designed to provide a visual representation of RGB colors through hexadecimal codes. The application features three sliders that allow users to modify the red, green, and blue components of a color. As adjustments are made, the application dynamically changes its background color to reflect the user's selections. Additionally, the hexadecimal code for the current color is displayed, enabling easy copying for use elsewhere.
